## About

This is a stock tracker app I created with a NodeJS backend and a ReactJS frontend. It allows a user to track certain stocks and display them in a list on their dashboard. This was a project I took on to learn how to use ReactJS to create an app, and I have to say, I think ReactJS has become one of my favorite libraries to use!

## Features
- Supports creating and using personal accounts
- Shows the value, change, and percent change in a stock
- Highlights stock in red or green depending on how they are performing

## Deploy
- Run `npm install` in both `stock-tracker-frontend` and `stock-tracker-backend`
- Run the `server.js` file in `/stock-tracker-backend` with `node server.js`
- Run the front-end with `npm start` in `/stock-tracker-frontend`
