## About

This is a stock tracker app I created with a NodeJS backend and a ReactJS frontend. It allows a user to track certain stocks and display them in a list on their dashboard. This was a project I took on to learn how to use ReactJS to create an app, and I have to say, I think ReactJS has become one of my favorite libraries to use!

## Features
- Supports creating and using personal accounts
- Shows the value, change, and percent change in a stock
- Highlights stock in red or green depending on how they are performing
